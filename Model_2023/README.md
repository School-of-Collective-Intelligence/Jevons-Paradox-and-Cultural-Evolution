Reinforcement learning model for the investigation of the coupling and decoupling processes between efficiency gains and resource consumption.

The file named Jevons_10.py contain the core classes and functions needed to run the model.

The file named Run_model_10.py is the main script that imports the above mentioned file to run the simulation.

# Jevons-Paradox-and-Cultural-Evolution
Exploration-exploitation model for the investigation of the coupling and decoupling processes between efficiency gains and resource consumption.

The file named Jevons_2.py contain the core classes and functions needed to run the model.

The file named Run_Jevons_2.py is the main script that imports the above mentioned file to run the simulation. In these scripts you can manipulate:

To run simulations, make sure the two files are in the same directory. Open the ```Run_Jevons_2``` file and declare the variables. To start with, we recommend you manipulate the values of the rebound variable, which can take values from 0 to 1.
